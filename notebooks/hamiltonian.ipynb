        "# This implementation correctly identifies π-systems for standard cases (aromatic rings,\n",

        "*   The 'H_pi' column stores the calculated Hückel π-electron Hamiltonian matrices for each corresponding SMILES string.\n",
        "*   For single atoms or molecules without pi-electron systems (e.g., 'C', 'N', 'O'), the 'H_pi' column correctly contains an empty list, indicating no π-Hamiltonian could be built.\n",
        "*   For molecules with pi-electron systems (e.g., 'C#C', 'C#N'), the `build_pi_huckel_hamiltonian` function successfully generated 2x2 Hückel matrices.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The `qm9_huckel` DataFrame is now prepared for subsequent quantum chemistry analyses, such as calculating eigenvalues, or for use in machine learning models that require molecular electronic structure information.\n",
        "*   Further investigation could involve analyzing the distribution of matrix sizes in the 'H_pi' column to understand the complexity of π-systems across the dataset, and explicitly documenting the convention of empty lists for non-pi systems.\n"
